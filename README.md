# badvent_of_code_21

Jerry's really horrendous at writing clean code. Or code at all.



## more details
I wrote most of this project first in Java first for speed, and then rewrote it in Python (and potentially other languages to learn). 

My initial speed (Java) code has not been refactored in any way - it is left as-is. 

My Python code makes use of `numpy` very heavily.
