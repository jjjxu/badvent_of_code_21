# badvent_of_code_21

Jerry's really horrendous at writing clean code. Or code at all.



## more details
I wrote most of this project first in Java first for speed, and then rewrote it in Python (and potentially other languages to learn). Day 12 was test-speed-written in Python to test how competitive/feasible it was.

My initial speed code has not been refactored in any way - it is left as-is. 

My Python code makes use of `numpy` very heavily. 

## results
